# Welcome to this Practical Code Test

Hi!  Congratulations for making it this far!  During this test, you are allowed to use any resources you may find helpful in order to accomplish the task.  You are free to approach the problem in whatever manner you decide.
# Files

Provided is a clean install of Laravel.  You are allowed to install and utilize any package you feel will help you get the job done.

# Problem to Solve

The purpose of this test is to gauge your skills in the day-to-day problems we come across.  For example, we deal with a fair amount of ETL (extract, transform, load) processes so it's only natural for us to give you a basic ETL task.  To start, we will need to get the results from an API every 24 hours.  We will then need to save that data to a file and process it into our database.  Once that's complete, we will also need the ability retrieve those results using an API endpoint.  P.S: Donâ€™t forget to test the code :wink:

## Resources
[API URL](https://61f07509732d93001778ea7d.mockapi.io/api/v1/user/users?page=1&limit=10)

Please use this link to fetch all users.  The list is paginated.  There is a max of 10 pages.  This number can be changed by altering the limit query parameter.
